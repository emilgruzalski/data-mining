# Heart Disease Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a project for analyzing heart disease data using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes two models: a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and an Extra Trees Classifier.

## Features
- Load data from a CSV file
- Split data into training and test sets
- Implementation of the MLP model from the `sklearn` library
- Implementation of the Extra Trees Classifier model
- Evaluation of models based on various metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the libraries mentioned above. If not, you can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and execute the `main.py` file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emilgruzalski/heart-disease.git
cd heart-disease
python main.py
```
