# Data Mining Projects Repository

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a distinct data mining project. These projects explore datasets related to automobile fuel efficiency, red wine characteristics, and heart disease indicators. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Automobile Fuel Efficiency Analysis (`auto_mpg.ipynb`)

- **Objective**: To analyze the fuel efficiency of various automobiles, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), and to understand how different vehicle characteristics influence fuel efficiency.
- **Dataset**: `auto_mpg.csv`
- **Key Aspects**: The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and possibly predictive modeling to assess fuel efficiency based on attributes like horsepower, weight, and engine displacement.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis of Red Wine (`red_wine.ipynb`)

- **Objective**: To perform an exploratory analysis of red wine characteristics, focusing on understanding the factors that influence wine quality.
- **Dataset**: `red_wine.csv`, which includes data on various chemical properties of wines and their quality ratings.
- **Key Aspects**: The analysis involves loading the dataset, data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to explore relationships between wine properties and quality.

### 3. Heart Disease Prediction Analysis (`heart.ipynb`)

- **Objective**: To analyze indicators of heart disease and to build a model capable of predicting heart disease presence based on clinical parameters.
- **Dataset**: `heart.csv`, containing clinical measures related to heart disease in individuals.
- **Key Aspects**: This notebook includes data cleaning, EDA, feature selection, and the application of machine learning models for prediction.
